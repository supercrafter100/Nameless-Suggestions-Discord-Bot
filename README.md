# Nameless-Suggestions Discord Bot

![Infographic of bot](https://i.imgur.com/wtCKREd.png)

## Publicly hosted instance

If you want to try out the bot, there is a publicly hosted instance that can be invited [here](https://nameless-suggestions.supercrafter100.com). Ideally you'd use this version as it gets updated for the latest namelessmc version + gets the newest features the quickest. Please note that I cannot guarantee that this instance will remain online forever. As long as I can cover the hosting costs and have interest in this project, it will stay online.

If you want to support this project or my work in general, it would be really appreciated if you donated over at https://ko-fi.com/supercrafter100 ❤️

## Self hosting (no support provided, if you don't know what you're doing, please use my hosted instance instead)

2. Clone the repository
3. Install all dependencies by executing `npm install -D`
4. Build the bot `npx tsc`
5. Create a `.env` file and put in the contents of the `.example.env` file that is included. Then fill in the values
